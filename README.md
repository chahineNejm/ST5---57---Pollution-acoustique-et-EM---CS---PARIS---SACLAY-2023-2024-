# Theoretical & Computational Acoustics â€” Final Project (Paris-Saclay 2023)
final grad 16/20 (A+)

This repository hosts the deliverables for my coursework project in **Theoretical and Computational Acoustics**. It focuses on modeling, analyzing, and numerically simulating acoustic wave propagation with physically grounded formulations and computational methods relevant to noise/EM pollution contexts.

##  Project at a Glance

- **Objective:** Study acoustic wave phenomena via first-principles PDEs and implement computational approaches for realistic scenarios (bounded/unbounded domains, heterogeneous media).
- **Core Theory:** Wave equation, time-harmonic **Helmholtz** formulation, boundary/impedance conditions, energy principles, modal/Green-function viewpoints.
- **Numerics:** Discretization strategies (FD/FE flavor), stabilization for high-frequency regimes, and validation against analytical references.
- **Outcomes:** Trade-offs between modeling assumptions vs. numerical cost/accuracy, and application-oriented insights for practical acoustic analysis.
